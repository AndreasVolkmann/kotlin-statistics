# Kotlin Statistics
Math and statistical extensions for Kotlin

This library will contain helpful extension functions to perform exploratory and production statistics and math operations.

### Numerical 

These will have support for `Integer`, `Long`, `BigDecial`, `Double`, and other numerical types contained in `Iterable`, `Sequence`, primitve arrays, etc...

* `variance()`
* `standardDeviation()`
* `weightedAverage()`
* `percentile()`
* `quartile()`
* `median()`
* `weightedMedian()`
* `trimmedAverage()`
* `zScore()`
* _more to come_

### Categorical

* `mode()`
* `countBy()` 

I will keep adding more as I brush up on my statistics and use these for work. Please feel free to share input as I keep adding to this library. I'll do a 0.x Maven Release once I have a tested core set of features.
